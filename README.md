# Python MuFile

A simple tool to help you organize your music library.

Features: Organizes your .mp3 files in folders by Artists/Albums/Tracks.

## Who is this for?

If you fit into any of these groups, this could be your salvation.

- Gave up on streaming services
- Prefer to listen by albums instead of creating playlists (or using shuffle on Liked Songs if you are mentally unstable)
- Want to start over from scratch after a failed organization

Requirements: .mp3 files need to have metadata such as Artist and Album name. If your library doesn't have such, I recommend these tools to help you:

- [Beets](https://beets.io/), a terminal tool to help you add metadata to your current library.
- [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/), same as before but with a Graphic User Interface.
- [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), downloads music from Spotify with full metadata.

Current Progress: 10%
